## About this project

This is a demo project for the [SecTester NET SDK framework](https://github.com/NeuraLegion/sectester-net), with some installation and usage examples. We recommend forking it and playing around, that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs for!

## About SecTester

Bright is a developer-first Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) scanner.

SecTester is a new tool that integrates our enterprise-grade scan engine directly into your unit tests.

With SecTester you can:

- Test every function and component directly
- Run security scans at the speed of unit tests
- Find vulnerabilities with no false positives, before you finalize your Pull Request

Trying out Bright‚Äôs SecTester is _**free**_ üí∏, so let‚Äôs get started!

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**
>
> The SecTester project is currently in beta as an early-access tool. We are looking for your feedback to make it the best possible solution for developers, aimed to be used as part of your team‚Äôs SDLC. We apologize if not everything will work smoothly from the start, and hope a few bugs or missing features will be no match for you!
>
> Thank you! We appreciate your help and feedback!

## Setup

### Fork and clone this repo

1.  Press the ‚Äòfork‚Äô button to make a copy of this repo in your own GH account
2.  In your forked repo, clone this project down to your local machine using either SSH or HTTP

### Get a Bright API key

1.  Register for a free account at Bright‚Äôs [**signup**](https://app.neuralegion.com/signup) page
2.  Optional: Skip the quickstart wizard and go directly to [**User API key creation**](https://app.neuralegion.com/profile)
3.  Create a Bright API key ([**check out our doc on how to create a user key**](https://docs.brightsec.com/docs/manage-your-personal-account#manage-your-personal-api-keys-authentication-tokens))
4.  Save the Bright API key
  1.  We recommend using your Github repository secrets feature to store the key, accessible via the `Settings > Security > Secrets > Actions` configuration. We use the ENV variable called `BRIGHT_TOKEN` in our examples
  2.  If you don‚Äôt use that option, make sure you save the key in a secure location. You will need to access it later on in the project but will not be able to view it again.
  3.  More info on [**how to use ENV vars in Github actions**](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/environment-variables)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your API key is saved in a location where you can retrieve it later! You will need it in these next steps!

### Explore the demo application

Navigate to your local version of this project. Then, in your command line, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ dotnet restore --use-lock-file
```

The whole list of required variables to start the demo application is described in `.env.example` file. The template for this .env file is available in the root folder.

After that, you can easily create a `.env` file from the template by issuing the following command:

```bash
$ cp .env.example .env
```

Once this template is done, copying over (should be instantaneous), navigate to your `.env` file, and paste your Bright API key as the value of the `BRIGHT_TOKEN` variable.

```text
BRIGHT_TOKEN = <your_API_key_here>
```

Then you have to build and run services with Docker. Start Docker, and issue the command as follows:

```bash
$ docker compose up -d
```

To initialize DB schema, you should execute a migration, as shown here:

```bash
$ dotnet ef database update --project src/App
```

Finally, perform this command in terminal to run the application:

```bash
$ dotnet run --project src/App
```

While having the application running, open a browser and type `http://localhost:3000/swagger`, and hit enter.
You should see the Swagger UI page for that application that allows you to test the RESTFul CRUD API, like in the following screenshot:

To explore the Swagger UI:

- Click on the `POST /users` endpoint
- Click on the "Try it out" button
- Click on the blue "Execute" button
- Then you should see a view similar to the following, where you can see the JSON returned from the API:
